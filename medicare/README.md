MediCare is a full-stack hospital portal built for CMPS 271 that streamlines patient–doctor interactions through a modern web interface and a Node.js/Express backend connected to MongoDB. The platform supports secure authentication (JWT + bcrypt), role-based accounts (patient/doctor), doctor profiles (specialty, license, experience, bio, working days and hours), and appointment management with booking/confirmation flows, with the database persisting users and scheduling data via Mongoose models. The project also includes an AI chatbot designed to act like a virtual hospital secretary to help guide users and assist with scheduling-related requests, and it was developed using HTML/Tailwind CSS for the frontend, MongoDB Compass for database management, and Git/GitHub for version control.
